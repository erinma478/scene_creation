Measurement and analysis scripts for "Scene saliencies in egocentric vision and creation by parents and infants"

This project analyzes scene saliences of still images extracted from infant head camera recordings.
  Image information:480 x 720 pixels, down-sampled at 5Hz
  Camera: Watec 90-degree diagonal field of view, recording at 30Hz and worn by the infant on a headband or hat with the camera lens set just over the eyes

Saliences we analyzed were:

- visual size of object
- object position
- luminance contrast, red-green and blue-yellow contrast of ROI
- amount of edges in ROI
- proportion of edges belonging to object
- number of objects in ROI
